you need to install face_recognition library
either switch to 3.10(already installed) or 3.12(need to install)
and then download all the libraries needed
and also download dlib library, the one i have is for 3.12
you need to see the github for 3.10 python dlib file

or

you can just use anaconda for running it
can only be run on computer i have
